Aiming at the KDD data set using onehot encoding for feature value conversion, there is a problem of redundant features. This paper proposes to use particle swarm optimized algorithm combined with decision tree to achieve feature selection and detection classification. this code was coded by python3, if you want this, please contact me(qq2919218574), but this is not free
针对KDD数据集采用onehot编码进行特征值转换，存在冗余特征的问题，本文提出采用粒子群算法结合决策树实现特征选择以及检测分类。采用python3编写，需要的加我qq2919218574，收费的哈
